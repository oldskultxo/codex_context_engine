# Codex Context Engine — Root Orchestrator Prompt

You are tasked with operating as the **root installer / upgrader orchestrator** for the `codex_context_engine` project.

This repository is structured as an **evolutionary prompt system**.
The canonical layout is:

```text
iterations/
  1/
    readme.md
    prompt.md
  2/
    readme.md
    prompt.md
  3/
    readme.md
    prompt.md
  4/
    readme.md
    prompt.md
  ...
```

Each numeric iteration represents a cumulative improvement to the same system.

The root prompt must **not** assume that the latest iteration fully replaces all previous ones.
Instead, the root prompt must:
1. detect the current installed iteration in the target repository
2. determine which iterations are missing
3. execute the missing iterations in ascending numeric order
4. preserve existing learnings, memory, telemetry, and configuration
5. work both for:
   - fresh installation
   - in-place upgrade

This prompt must be designed so it **does not need to be rewritten every time a new iteration is added**.
It must dynamically inspect the `iterations/` directory and use whatever numeric iterations exist.

---

# PRIMARY GOAL

Install or upgrade the Codex Context Engine in the target repository by applying all required iterations in the correct order.
The system must be robust, incremental, and safe.

It must never blindly reinstall everything if a partial or full installation already exists.
It must never destroy useful state unless cleanup is clearly required and safe.

---

# OPERATING MODEL

Treat this repository as the **source of truth** for the Codex Context Engine.
Treat the target repository (the repo where this prompt is being executed) as the **installation target**.

Your task is to inspect the target repository, determine what version of the engine is already installed, and then apply only the iterations that are still missing.

---

# DO NOT HARDCODE ITERATION COUNT

Do not assume the latest iteration number is 4.
Instead:
1. inspect the local `iterations/` directory in this repository
2. discover all numeric iteration folders dynamically
3. sort them numerically ascending
4. treat the highest discovered number as the latest available iteration

This rule is mandatory.

The root orchestrator must continue working when new iterations are added later without requiring manual changes to this root prompt.

---

# ITERATION DISCOVERY RULES

Within this repository:
- only numeric folders under `iterations/` count as iterations
- ignore non-numeric folders or auxiliary files
- each valid iteration folder should contain:
  - `readme.md`
  - `prompt.md`

If an iteration folder is malformed:
- do not fail immediately
- report the issue clearly
- continue if safe
- do not invent missing iteration content

---

# TARGET REPOSITORY DETECTION

Before applying anything, inspect the target repository for signs of an existing Codex Context Engine installation.

Possible evidence may include:
- `AGENTS.md`
- `.codex_memory/`
- `.context_metrics/`
- `.codex_global_metrics/`
- `.codex_failure_memory/`
- `.codex_task_memory/`
- `CONTEXT_SAVINGS.md`
- files or comments explicitly mentioning `codex_context`
- iteration metadata files if present
- prior generated schemas, summaries, scoring metadata, telemetry, optimizer artifacts, planner artifacts, failure-memory artifacts, or task-memory artifacts

Use these signals to determine whether the engine is already installed and, if possible, which iteration level has already been applied.

---

# INSTALLATION STATE DETECTION

Your first responsibility is to determine the **current installed iteration** in the target repository.
Use this strategy, in order:

## 1. Explicit state markers
If the target repository contains a clear iteration/version marker, use it.
Examples:
- installed iteration metadata file
- version field in a configuration file
- explicit note in generated engine artifacts

## 2. Structural capability detection
If no explicit marker exists, infer the installed iteration by detecting installed capabilities.
Use conservative inference.

Example signals by capability:

### Iteration 1 signals
- basic external memory artifacts
- persistent preference storage
- primitive memory structure
- fallback-oriented context memory setup

### Iteration 2 signals
- structured `.codex_memory/`
- telemetry artifacts such as `.context_metrics/`
- `CONTEXT_SAVINGS.md`
- validation-oriented files
- more explicit bootstrap / delta retrieval setup

### Iteration 3 signals
- deterministic context packet schema
- relevance scoring metadata
- compaction reports or compaction utilities
- scoring-aware memory records

### Iteration 4 signals
- `.codex_global_metrics/`
- project registration in global metrics
- global savings aggregation
- system health report for the engine

### Iteration 5 signals
- context budget markers
- packet cost estimation artifacts
- optimizer summaries or trimming reports
- context compression or value-aware optimization logic

### Iteration 6 signals
- planner artifacts
- pre-execution context planning outputs
- task/routing hints for retrieval
- planning metadata linked to packet assembly

### Iteration 7 signals
- `.codex_failure_memory/`
- structured failure records
- root-cause / solution entries
- debugging-oriented reuse of prior failures

### Iteration 8 signals
- `.codex_task_memory/`
- task-type categories such as bug fixing, refactoring, testing, performance, architecture, or feature work
- deterministic task-type inference artifacts
- task-specialized retrieval behavior or summaries

Infer the highest iteration that is **safely supported by the evidence**.
If uncertain, prefer a lower installed iteration rather than overestimating.

## 3. Fresh install assumption
If no meaningful evidence exists, assume no installation is present.

---

# EXECUTION RULE

Once the current installed iteration is known:
- if none is installed, apply all iterations in ascending order
- if iteration N is installed, apply N+1 through latest
- if latest is already installed, do not reinstall blindly

Even if the latest iteration appears installed, you may still:
- normalize malformed files
- repair clearly incomplete artifacts
- report inconsistencies
- avoid destructive rewrites

---

# HOW TO APPLY EACH ITERATION

For each missing iteration:
1. open `iterations/<n>/prompt.md`
2. treat it as the authoritative specification for that iteration
3. apply the required changes in the target repository
4. preserve existing compatible state
5. perform migrations only when necessary
6. avoid duplicating content unnecessarily
7. continue to the next missing iteration

You must apply iterations strictly in ascending order.

Do not skip an intermediate iteration unless:
- its folder is missing or malformed, and
- proceeding is still safe, and
- you clearly report the limitation

---

# UPGRADE SAFETY RULES

When upgrading an existing installation:
- preserve memory records whenever possible
- preserve telemetry unless it is clearly broken or incompatible
- preserve preferences unless normalization is required
- preserve existing `AGENTS.md` rules unless they conflict with engine behavior
- prefer in-place upgrades
- avoid replacing the whole system if only one layer is missing

Never erase useful history just because a newer iteration exists.

---

# AGENTS.md POLICY

If `AGENTS.md` exists in the target repository:
- update it carefully
- merge new engine requirements without destroying unrelated project instructions
- avoid duplicated sections
- preserve user/project-specific instructions whenever possible

If `AGENTS.md` does not exist:
- create it only if required by the iterations being applied

The Codex Context Engine should continue using `AGENTS.md` as the authoritative runtime policy layer when the installed iterations require that pattern.

---

# STATE TRACKING

To make future upgrades reliable, ensure the installation leaves behind a **clear installed iteration marker** in the target repository.

Preferred options include one of the following:
- a lightweight metadata file
- a version field in an existing engine file
- a clearly named engine state artifact

The marker should minimally record:
- engine identifier: `codex_context_engine`
- installed iteration number
- timestamp of last upgrade

Keep it lightweight and machine-readable.

If a compatible marker already exists, update it.
This is important so future executions of the root prompt can detect state reliably.

---

# COMPATIBILITY WITH FUTURE ITERATIONS

This root prompt must remain forward-compatible.
That means:
- do not refer to a fixed final iteration number
- always derive available iterations from the `iterations/` directory
- always use discovered iteration prompts as the source of truth
- always upgrade only from current state to latest discovered state

This root prompt should remain valid even after Iteration 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and beyond are added.

---

# FAILURE HANDLING

If one iteration cannot be applied cleanly:
1. stop before making unsafe assumptions
2. preserve the target repository state as much as possible
3. report exactly which iteration failed and why
4. report which iterations were successfully applied before the failure
5. do not pretend the engine is fully upgraded if it is not

If partial upgrade is the safest outcome, say so clearly.

---

# VALIDATION AFTER UPGRADE

After applying the missing iterations:
1. verify that the installed iteration marker reflects the highest successfully applied iteration
2. verify that major artifacts expected by the applied iterations exist
3. verify that the installation remains coherent
4. verify that no obvious destructive conflict was introduced
5. report any caveat or incomplete area

Do not fabricate validation.
Keep it honest and concise.

---

# GIT SAFETY

If generated support files are created in Git-controlled directories:
- update `.gitignore` when appropriate
- do not accidentally ignore real source files
- preserve intentional tracking if the repository already tracks certain engine artifacts on purpose

---

# EVOLUTION ROADMAP

The engine evolves through additive capability layers.

- **Iteration 5 — Context Cost Optimizer**  
  Reduces token usage and latency by estimating packet cost, applying budget thresholds, trimming low-value context, and producing cost observability.

- **Iteration 6 — Context Planner**  
  Determines what context should be loaded before execution begins, routing retrieval through explicit planning signals.

- **Iteration 7 — Failure Memory**  
  Stores prior failures, root causes, and reusable fixes so the engine can avoid repeated debugging mistakes.

- **Iteration 8 — Task-Specific Memory**  
  Adds specialized memory categories by task domain so the engine can retrieve more relevant context for debugging, refactoring, testing, performance work, architecture work, and similar workflows.

- **Iteration 9 — Memory Graph**  
  Introduces relationship-aware memory so decisions, modules, patterns, and failures can be connected structurally.

---
